# stack_widget_with_flutter

The Stack widget has two types of child widgets:

Positioned widgets: These are wrapped in the Positioned widget and are positioned using the top, right, left, and bottom properties, allowing for precise control of their placement within the stack.
Non-positioned widgets: These are simply placed in the Stack without being wrapped in a Positioned widget. By default, they are aligned to the top-left corner unless you specify a different alignment using the alignment property.
